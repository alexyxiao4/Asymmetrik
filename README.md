# Asymmetrik
Unfortunately the language I have most recently had a good amount of practice in is actually C, I've been learning Python for a few weeks and I haven't touched Java in about 4 months. 
Additionally, due to the interface requirements which feel almost tailor-made to Java, I couldn't use the implementation I wished to use. If I had complete freedom, I simply would have parsed the user input, and put words into a Counter to significantly reduce both space and speed for Train. For input I would have made a temporary dict to hold word(key): occurences(values) if the string fragment was part of the keys, sorted in descending order, and directly printed the dict if I didn't have to worry about formatting. 
Please have python3 downloaded on Linux. To run the code find the directory the file is in and type: "python3 mobile_device_keyboard.py". 
The only accepted commands are: Train: input_string, Input: string_fragment, exit, and ? directly into the linux client e.g:

$ Train: Hello there friend!

$ Input: e

$ ?

$ exit
